TITLE: Dictionary Management
CONTENT:

The captions and messages, which we call "dictionary", used in our products
are now in state of confusion.

There're so many products, for example HR series has 3 products,
that is, CJK, CWS and CSR, and each product has their own way
to manage the captions and messages. That means each product
has their own database table, and each has different key columns.
And adding to that, lack of sufficient communication with each other
caused the situation that some "dictionaries"are slight different
between the products.

And what is worse, WAP has been heading for global market and
each product separatedly tried to translate their "dictionaries"
in some way. Some products decided to asked a company to translate
their "dictionaries", other products tried to translate their "dictionaries"
on their own, using developers who know the product well.


Against this confused state, we wants you:
- to unify each "dictionaries"
- make it easy for everyone in every department(**) to use "dictionary" data

(**) e.g. sales, consultants and of course development departments

[Constraints]
Server-side programming language: Java (You can use OSS libraries like Spring)
Database: Oracle
